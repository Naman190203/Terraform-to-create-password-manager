# Terraform-to-create-password-manager
This project implements a cloud-based password manager using Terraform and Azure Key Vault. The goal is to automate the secure creation, storage, rotation, and management of secrets without manual intervention. By leveraging Terraformâ€™s infrastructure-as-code approach, the solution ensures consistent and repeatable deployment of secrets.
